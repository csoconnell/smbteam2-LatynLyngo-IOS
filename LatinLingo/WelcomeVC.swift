        Morphemes are the smallest meaningful
        parts of a word. They can be used together
        (prefix, root, suffix) to build words.
        A Few morphemes build a Lot of words.
        Latyn Lyngo is a vocabulary learning app.
        You will use morphemes
        (the smallest meaningful parts of words; prefixes, roots, suffixes)
        to build words.
        Once you know the parts you will be able to build many more words from those parts. Some morpheme roots build hundreds of words.

        You can study by choosing a morpheme and concentrating on that word part.
        You can choose the Random word study.
        Finally, you can use the Nonsense mode and have unrelated morphemes drop into the slots and you get to make up the word.
        Shakespeare was known as The Bard and was famous for making up words. Be the Bard!
